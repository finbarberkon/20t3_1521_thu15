On a machine with 16-bit ints, the C expression (30000 + 30000) yields a
negative result.

Why the negative result? How can you make it produce the correct result?

The negative result is because a signed 16 bit int can only hold values
from -32,768 to +32,767. We could correct the result by providing a
bigger integer type, like a 32 bit int.
